## What I have learnt while making this project?

> Although, after completing the last two projects, I have got the hands-on knowledge on Position property, but in this project I have developed the Landing Page without the Position property, as it was not needed in my opinion.

#

## Time taken to complete this project:
> Around 6hrs. Took this long bcoz first I had used Position property but then I tried developing it without it, also refined it more.
